# 🧠 Efficient Kernels

Welcome to **Open LM Engine**, a GitHub organization dedicated to developing **high-performance tools, libraries, and methods** for training **large-scale machine learning models**. Our mission is to **push the boundaries of computational efficiency**, enabling faster, more scalable, and cost-effective AI training.

## 🚀 Mission

Training large models—from transformer-based architectures to multimodal networks—demands innovative solutions across the stack: from custom CUDA kernels to memory-efficient training paradigms. At Open LM Engine, we:

- Develop optimized GPU kernels (other accelerators to follow) for deep learning workloads  
- Explore sparsity, quantization, and other model compression techniques  
- Build training frameworks for large scale models  
- Share research-driven open-source tools with the community  

---

## 🧪 Research & Engineering

We combine research insights with engineering best practices. Our work is inspired by:

- Recent breakthroughs in model efficiency (e.g., FlashAttention, ZeRO etc)  
- Papers and implementations from top conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)  
- Real-world scalability needs in LLM and foundation model training
